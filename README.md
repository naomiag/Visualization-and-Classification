# Visualization-and-Classification

Here my code about Visualization and Classification with python, which I did using Google Colab. 
The code was containing some advanced query for fullfill the case's needs.

The objective of the visualization case was to make a visualization from transaction data of company 
that provided food delivery service to restaurants.

The objective of the classification case was to make a prediction model that can predict 
whether or not a storm is coming. The task was to creat classification model and test it
to given file.


Note:
The storm_Training.csv and Storm_testing.csv contained columns, which were atmospheric_preassure,
visible_cloud, wind_direction, wind_speed, sky_color, ocean_wave_speed, temperature, animal_activity,
storm_coming.
